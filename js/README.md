前端发展很快，现代浏览器原生 API 已经足够好用。我们并不需要为了操作 DOM、Event 等再学习一下 jQuery 的 API。同时由于 React、Angular、Vue 等框架的流行，直接操作 DOM 不再是好的模式，jQuery 使用场景大大减少。本项目总结了大部分 jQuery API 替代的方法，暂时只支持 IE10 以上浏览器。



Frontend environments evolve rapidly nowadays and modern browsers have already implemented a great deal of DOM/BOM APIs which are good enough for production use. We don't have to learn jQuery from scratch for DOM manipulation or event handling. In the meantime, thanks to the spread of frontend libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, manipulating the DOM directly becomes anti-pattern, so that jQuery usage has never been less important. This project summarizes most of the alternatives in native Javascript implementation to jQuery methods, with IE 10+ support.

Note: jQuery is still a great library and has many valid use cases. Don’t migrate away if you don’t want to!
